This song debuted by breaking several records --most viewed in a single day in Youtube history, most commented video on the platform, and second most commented video of all time. Also, thi song hit No.1 on the Billboard for total three weeks; No.1 on Spotify's daily Global Top 50 chart; No.1s on iTunes within 8 hours. This song even broke the record for the fastest viral music video by generating 101.1 million views within 24 hours, according to [Statstia](https://www.statista.com/statistics/478082/fastest-viral-videos-views-in-24-hours/#:~:text=In%20August%202020%2C%20South%20Korean,record%20of%2086.3%20million%20views.). \n\n\n## BTS songs and lyrics are catchy and that get stuck in my head! \n\nWhenever I listen to BTS songs, it get stuck in my head.\n\nPersonally, I prefer listening to songs with positive vibe because it really effects my mood. I don't personally like listening to songs about bullying and mental health. BTS songs motivates me with relatable and inspirational words (i.e., \"Love Yourself\", \"Life Goes On\", etc.). See this reference [5 Reasons Why You Should Stan BTS) \n(https://thehoneypop.com/2019/12/16/5-reasons-to-stan-bts/)\n\nIn this notebook, I want to see which words were used the most in each BTS songs via [word embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding), then visualize lyrics similarity using a machine learning method called t_SNE and an interactive visualizing library called Bokeh.
